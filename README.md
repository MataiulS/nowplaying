# nowplaying
Simple now playing app for macOS.
It should work with every player.
In the inform player, it should be wrote this way: player, index (without .).
The index should be the index from the music, from the files open by the player process.
For example, for deadbeef it would be: deadbeef, 0
Uses UTF-8 encode, so it work's with asian letters.
Hope it works.
